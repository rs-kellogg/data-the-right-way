# Kellogg Datasets

Kellogg hosts many datasets. The [Kellogg Research Support website](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research-support/dataset.aspx) has detailed information on them, including how to access them. For example, here is the entry for the Comscore dataset:


```{note}
Highlighting a dataset will pop up a "Data Card" providing many details on the dataset and how to access it. Here is the data card for the Comscore dataset:

```{note}
Datasets hosted by Kellogg can be found in several places, three of which we will describe here:

* [Kellogg Linux Cluster](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research-support/computing/kellogg-linux-cluster.aspx)
* [Kellog Data Center](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research-support/computing/kellogg-data-center.aspx)
* [Kellog Data Cloud](https://nu-sso.awsapps.com/start/#/)
```

```{warning}
The Kellogg Data Center will be retired this Summer. At that time, the acronym "KDC" will take on a new meaning, and will refer to the The <span style="color:purple">*Kellogg Data Cloud*</span>.
