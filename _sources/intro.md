# Data the Right Way

- These workshop materials cover some highlights on how to work with datasets at Kellogg.
- We will look at how to query datasets hosted Kellogg Data Cloud (KDC), as well as datasets hosted on the Kellogg Linux Cluster (KLC).
- When datasets are small, it doesn't much matter how we access them. We can pretend that resources don't matter. But when they get really large, queries can take a very long time, or can even fail to complete. We will look at strategies for working with large datasets.
- We will also provide some tips on how to automate data workflows in order to make your research more easily reproducible. Your future self will thank you!
