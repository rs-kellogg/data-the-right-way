# Athena Performance 

## Massively Parallel Queries

Athena carries out queries simultaneously, so even queries on very large 
datasets can be obtained within seconds. Due to Athenaâ€™s distributed, 
serverless architecture, it can support large numbers of users and queries, and 
computing resources like CPU and RAM are seamlessly provisioned.
