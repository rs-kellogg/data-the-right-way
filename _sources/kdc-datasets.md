# KDC Datasets

* "KDC" is temporarily an ambiguous acronym. It can refer to the Kellogg Data Center or the Kellogg Data Cloud.
*  The [Kellogg Data Center](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research-support/computing/kellogg-data-center.aspx) is a Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system that is currently available to Kellogg faculty and students.

* Kellogg Data Center is nearing the end of its life and is being replaced by a cloud-based solution, the "Kellogg Data Cloud". When this happens later this year, the term will no longer be ambiguous and "KDC" will always refer to the Kellogg Data Cloud.

* There are many similarities between these two systems, including the ability to use SQL clients and ODBC-based connections from software like R, Python, and Stata. The cloud-based version has the advantage of being able to handle larger datasets, and allowing us to take advantage of the many tools available in the cloud.
