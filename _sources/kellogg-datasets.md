# Kellogg Datasets

Kellogg hosts many datasets. The [Kellogg Research Support website](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research-support/dataset.aspx) has detailed information on them, including how to access them. 

Datasets hosted by Kellogg can be found in several places, three of which we will describe here:

* [Kellogg Linux Cluster](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research-support/computing/kellogg-linux-cluster.aspx)
* [Kellog Data Center](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research-support/computing/kellogg-data-center.aspx)
* [Kellog Data Cloud](https://nu-sso.awsapps.com/start/#/)
