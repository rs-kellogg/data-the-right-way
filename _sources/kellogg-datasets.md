# Kellogg Datasets

Kellogg hosts several dozen [datasets](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research-support/dataset.aspx).

They can be found in several places, three of which we will describe here:

* The Kellogg Linux Cluster ([KLC](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research-support/computing/kellogg-linux-cluster.aspx))
* The Kellog Data Center ([KDC0](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research-support/computing/kellogg-data-center.aspx))
